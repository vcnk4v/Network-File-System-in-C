If you haven't read Game of Thrones you totally should.

It has such great lines such as
“It all goes back and back. To our mothers and fathers and theirs before them. We are puppets dancing on the 
strings of those who came before us, and one day our own children will take up our strings and dance on in our steads.”

The plot in the show is actually ahead of the novels as GRRM hasn't released a dance of dragons yet. Here's a quote from the TV show - 
"I’m not going to stop the wheel. I’m going to break the wheel." — Daenerys Targaryen

Tbh, this sounds like it has been heavily derived from Wheel of Time. 

Regardless, if you actually bothered reading the above random text and want some suggestions for fantasy and other general fiction, here you go - 
1. A Song of Ice and Fire
2. Inheritance Cycle
3. Wheel of Time
4. The Name of the Wind
5. Harappa Series (Bajpai)
6. Bartimaeus Sequence
7. The Witcher
8. Gravity Falls (Duh)
9. OSTEP
10. Inside Job (Netflix)
